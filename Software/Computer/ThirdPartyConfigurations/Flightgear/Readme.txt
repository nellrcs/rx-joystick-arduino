Copy the folder "rx_arduino" to "<path-to-flightgear-installation>/Input/Joysticks/".
It contains joystick configuration file(s) that will allow you to fly directly with your RC receiver,
connect the RC receiver correctly with the Arduino (4 or 6 channels, 6 prefered),
you need to run 'python serialToJoystick.py' (may need to be run as root),
and then start Flightgear.
