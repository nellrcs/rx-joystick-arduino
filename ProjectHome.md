Use your RC transmitter (to send data to the RC receiver), which is connected to a computer via an Arduino (shield).

  * (The RC receiver is powered by the Arduino's 5V output, originating from the computer via an USB cable (using serial communication).)
  * The interface between the Arduino and the RC receiver (or transmitter) is accomplished by a simple home-made Arduino shield, for which manufacturing details are supplied.
  * On the computer, the serial data is processed and translated to a virtual joystick controller with maximum 8 channels.
  * The user can choose to use either all the channels of the receiver as input, or the combined PPM output of the transmitter via a D.S.C. cable.

This can be used to learn to control a RC plane in combination with a flight-simulator.
Or it can be used as a race game controller.
Or to control a computer-controlled home automation system.
Of course you can use it also for various other things, for example as a MIDI controller.
