README
------

All documentation is provided on the wiki pages of the project page "http://code.google.com/p/rx-joystick-arduino/",
so head to "http://code.google.com/p/rx-joystick-arduino/wiki/list".

If you don't want to read the documentation,
the directory structure is straightforward enough to help you get it running.
